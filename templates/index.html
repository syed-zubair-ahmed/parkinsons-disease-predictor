      <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. It usually begins gradually, sometimes with a barely noticeable tremor in one hand. Apart from tremors, it can also cause stiffness or a slowing of movement.</p>
      <p>Early symptoms include reduced facial expression, diminished arm swing while walking, and slurred or soft speech. These symptoms worsen over time as the disease progresses.</p>
      <p>While there is no cure, medications and sometimes surgery can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.</p>
      <p>Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled the analysis of voice data — called vocal biomarkers — to help detect Parkinson’s disease early.</p>
      <p>This tool uses 22 features from vocal signal data. Once entered, a trained model analyzes them to predict the likelihood of Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This system is meant for early screening and awareness. It is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.</p>
