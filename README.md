echo "# Parkinson's Disease Detection Web App

This project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice features. It uses a trained machine learning model (initially Random Forest, with the option to use XGBoost) and is built with Flask, Scikit-learn, and styled using Tailwind CSS.

---

## Project Overview

The app analyzes 22 vocal attributes derived from patients’ voice recordings and predicts whether the individual is likely to have Parkinson’s Disease. It serves as a demonstration of how machine learning can support early disease detection.

> Note: This application is meant for educational and demonstration purposes and is **not** a replacement for professional medical advice or diagnosis.

- Model training using Random Forest or XGBoost  
- Input scaling using \`StandardScaler\`  
- Displays prediction results with confidence percentage  
- Modular Flask structure for easy maintenance and extension
